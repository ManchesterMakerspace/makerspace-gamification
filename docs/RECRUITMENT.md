# Recruitment and opt-in

The Ledger is opt-in. A sponsorship invitation is only an invitation to learn about The Ledger; it does not create an account, grant channel access, or award XP. The recipient must explicitly choose **Opt in to The Ledger** or run `/ledger join`. Invitation history and the first sponsor's recruitment credit are separate from consent. Recruitment XP is awarded only after the invitee opts in and completes a qualifying, verified learning or service milestone.

## Invite a maker

An opted-in participant can invite an eligible linked member with `/ledger sponsor @member`. Sending kudos with **Send kudos and invite them to The Ledger** also records an invitation. The `/kudos` message remains the sender's authored text; the invitation does not enroll the recipient.

Use `/ledger sponsor` with no options to view your own invitations, newest first, with each invitee's invitation date, current opt-in state, and latest opt-in/out dates. The report is private and does not disclose another sponsor's history.

When an invitation DM is delivered, a participant with a reminder from the previous seven days receives an updated reminder DM thanking them for growing The Ledger. When their invitee accepts, that same recent reminder is updated with a Qwen-generated thank-you naming the new participant and suggesting a personal welcome in Ledge Chat. The reminder timestamp and original sent date remain attached to the reminder. These follow-ups do not create additional XP.

## Operator reminders

Run the one-shot reminder script from the application environment:

```powershell
python -m ledger.sponsorship_reminder --days never
python -m ledger.sponsorship_reminder --days 30 --limit 25 --verbose
```

`--days never` selects opted-in participants with no recorded invitations. `--days N` selects participants who have invited before but have no invitation in the last N days. N must be a positive integer. Candidates must have a valid linked human Slack identity. A new DM is sent if there is no reminder or its sent date is at least seven days old; a more recent reminder is updated in place and keeps its original sent date.

Useful options:

- `--variants path.json` selects a JSON variants file. The default sample is `ledger/sponsorship_reminder_variants.json`; it includes never-inviter reminders, previous-inviter reminders, and accepted-invitation thank-you prompts. The accepted-invitation template is saved with the participant's latest reminder receipt so the follow-up uses that run's selected file.
- `--dry-run` lists eligible members, planned send/update actions, and the prompt intended for Qwen without sending messages or writing to MongoDB.
- `--dry-run --generate` generates and displays proposed text instead of the prompt, still without sending or writing.
- `--limit N` caps the number of participants processed; `--member ID` limits the run to one internal member ID or linked Slack user ID.
- `--verbose` and `--debug` write Mongo errors, Slack errors, and Slack 429 backoff notices to STDERR. The live-run totals on STDOUT report new messages sent, reminders updated, failed message operations, and Mongo documents updated.

The script uses `MLAB_URI` only for source reads and `LEDGER_URI` for owned collection reads/writes, along with the configured Slack bot and Qwen endpoints. It never reads or writes source collections. Review the dry-run output before a first live run.

The canonical recruitment narration policy is in the [Prompt Matrix Template](../ledger/prompts/prompt_matrix.xml.md). If the deployment uses a Google Doc override, copy the corresponding policy update there and explicitly reload it with `/ledger-admin reload-prompts`; the script does not edit or publish that document.
